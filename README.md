# Machine Learning for Aerospace Engineering

This repository will store the files required to perform various projects as titled by the folder names. Each folder will correspond to a project.

Contents of repository :

- Linear_regression_algorithm : 
This program will read and attempt to perform linear regression on a set of 2-Dimensional (x-y) data as well as plot the results of the regression fit on top of the actual data. This program is also able to perform multivariable linear regression for data that require higher order regression fits applied to accurately simulate the data.

- Kmeans_algorithm :
This program will read and attempt to cluster a set of data using the K means method of clustering.
